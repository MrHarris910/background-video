# React-Background-Video-Player

This project is another of my coding exersizes that I will later implement in a future project.
I will be honest here and say, I am unsure if I'm properly using GitHub or if this is the proper way of using.
But, for me at least, this is a great way of keeping track of certain projects and files I will need later in
the future.

This project is a single feature, Showing how exactly you would add a background video in a react web app.

Video: How to create a video Background Component in React JS - With A Background Overlay

Note: there isn't much to the CSS in this repo, Just stretching the video to fit the viewport height, 0px of padding and 100% width.
certain dimensions may vary based on the video used and the dimensions of the video, the video i used was square so I couldnt follow
along directly. And I use Vite, so code is clean with no Vulnerabilities.
